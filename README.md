# Massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) and functional genomics analyses for the manuscript titled "Long-term isolation and archaic introgression shape functional genetic variation in Near Oceania"

See the main repository for the manuscript: https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PIBv1_manuscript/.

## MPRA analyses scripts here

- PIBv1_MPRA_pilot: Analyses based on the pilot archaic introgression dataset used to create the MPRA. Run PIBv1_MPRA_pilot/scripts/main_runall.sh in order.
- PIBv1_MPRA_final: Analyses based on the final archaic introgression dataset used in the manuscript. Run PIBv1_MPRA_final/scripts/main_runall.sh in order.
- PIBv1_MPRA_enrichr: Enrichr gene set enrichment input gene sets, output pathway enrichments, and scripts for figures.
- PIBv1_MPRA_collate: Scripts for collating MPRA and functional genomic analyses into intermediate files used for supplementary tables.
- PIBv1_MPRA_mpra: MRPA sequencing analysis pipeline. Download from Zenodo (see below).
- ../Datasets: Genomic or functional genomic annotations used in this project. Download from Zenodo (see below).
